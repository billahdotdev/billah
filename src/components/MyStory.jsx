                            üôÇ I am passionate about JavaScript and web
                            technologies. Before the pandemic, I was just a
                            struggling entrepreneur in the clothing industry.
                            'GARMENTIK' is a company where I hustled as a
                            rainmaker. My business had its ups and downs, which
                            were stressful, but I was learning something new
                            every day. During the pandemic, I decided to bring
                            my passion into the business. Nowadays, two roles in
                            my real-life game are:
